- 👋 Hi, I’m @dh107, a researcher working on carbon emission (CO2) inventories for world's major cities.
- 👀 I’m interested in the applications of data science and AI in climate change related research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Q-learning (DQN, a reinforcement learning method).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on city-level carbon emission inventories using carbon accounting, satellite remote sensing and GIS.
