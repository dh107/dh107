- 👋 Hi, I’m @dh107, a researcher working on carbon emission (CO2) datasets for world's major cities (https://cities.carbonmonitor.org).
- 👀 I’m interested in the applications of data science and AI in climate change related research.
- 🌱 I’m also building a smart fleet management system using Deep reinforcement learning (Deep Q-learning).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on city-level carbon emission inventories using carbon accounting, satellite remote sensing and GIS.
